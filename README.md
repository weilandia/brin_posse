Brin is a basic rails app used to connect a community of programmers who hold each other accountable to regular pairing sessions and continual improvement. The is one unique aspect of this project, however, that makes it special: In order to streamline the data shown on the app, we implemented a custom API endpoint in the exercism.io codebase to retrieve user stats.  [Here's some of the code we wrote for exercism.io](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/pull/2818/files).

Production is hosted [here](https://brin.herokuapp.com).
